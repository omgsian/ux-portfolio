Last November, I took a two weeks solo trip to Japan. At the time, I was overwhelmed by everything in my life. I needed to get away, even if momentarily, to learn to be my own again. Despite the mishaps that happened on the trip, I received countless help — for which I'm grateful — from friends and strangers alike. I was glad, on hindsight, that I listened to wise advice and pressed on with my journey. Armed with local maps, a backpack containing a survivor's kit and the knowledge that I know what to do in the event of a wild bear attack, I climbed three mountains: Mount Hiei in Kyoto, Mount Mizen in Hiroshima and Mount Koya in Wakayama and then, trekked a full day on Kumano Kodo, an ancient pilgrimage trail in Tanabe, a city south of Osaka in the Wakayama Prefecture.

There's something extraordinary - perhaps, magical even - about walking through the dense forests and then, trailing off full-speed ahead on uncharted paths not fully knowing where they led. I had my way of praying for safe passage. I talked to the birds and flowers. I sang when singing was not prescribed. Occasionally, I'd see foxes run unconcerned by my presence. I bowed my head often at anything and everything — the shrines, the trinkets clothed in algae, the Torii gates, the little water streams that flowed over smooth rocks and dirt before joining themselves at the river - to remind myself that I was now a guest in the homes of the deities and spirits that lived in these places.

I stood still repeatedly and for prolonged periods listening to the stillness. I marvelled at the sight of ancient cedar trees standing majestically; and when I knew I was completely alone, I would hug them. Around me, the wind blows carrying with it the soft whispers of past pilgrims. The leaves stir harmoniously following the rhythms set by the breeze. In the far distant, I could hear the faint sounds of crickets singing. 

When weariness hit, as it often did, the trees call out to me and say, “Stay awhile, traveller, and take shelter in my shade.” As I rested my tired body at the tree stumps, the light flows down from their branches and onto my face. And then, they call again, “It’s easy,” they say, “you have come into the world for a purpose, to be in flow, to walk in nature, to be filled with light, and to shine.”
