# My values

## Transparency
I value transparency in my personal and professional relationships, and I'm proud to be honest about who I am and what I stand for. Transparency creates trust, and trust is critical to building strong and honest relationships.

## Closeness
I am a person who values and cherishes relationships. Within reason, I invest time and effort into getting to know people, listening to their goals, and helping them become the best version of themselves. 

## Connection
I love connecting people to others I know. I've deeply benefited from people who've shared their personal connections with me. And believe strongly in doing the same for others.

## Knowledge sharing
Sharing knowledge is one of my passions.  I love to see other people benefit from the things that I know, and I do my best to share everything openly with others. I deeply appreciate when others do the same for me.

## Continuous learning
I seek to understand the world around me, and I live with a strong belief that knowledge brings happiness and meaning. In my spare time, I am constantly learning new things by reading books and articles online as well as attending events and conferences.
