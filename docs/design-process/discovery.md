# Discovery   

Discovery is the process in which I look at both the present and future states. I speak to customers to identify unmet needs and  unaddressed challenges - or as I call it, the gap. I study both direct and indirect competitors to learn how they're closing the gaps. And, I learn about the latest glimpses of possible future from advanced development, technique, innovations on the frontiers that I can bring into the project. 

The typical activities that I engage in during this process are:

* Competitive analysis.
* Subject matter expert interviews.
* Customer interviews.
* Thought leadership articles. 

## Example outputs

* Customer personas
* Journey maps
* Needs landscape
* Competitor analysis document
