# Know context

Knowing context is the process in which I gather information on the reasons or motivations behind why the project started.

The typical activities that I do in this process are:

* **Conduct stakeholder interviews.** Knowing why this problem is worth solving from a business perspective gives clarity on how to connect those business goals to design goals. I identify and map stakeholders on a [2x2 matrix](https://www.mindtools.com/media/Diagrams/stakeholder-analysis-figure1-2020.jpg), and then, interview them to understand their perspective and how this change impacts them. Will this project potentially lead to higher sign-ups? Will this change reduce complaints from customers? Will this change improve a problematic funnel that's causing a negative user experience? Will this change impact the work that they do now?
* **Acquire past (internal) documents about the problem.** Learning the historical context from existing documents (e.g. customer research, customer support tickets) expands my understanding of the need for change, explains why things are the way they are, and sometimes informs what might be.

## Expected outputs

* A one-page [design brief](../resources.md)
* A clearer understanding on the business goals, and how it influences design goals
* A full view of the involved stakeholders, their level of influence, and impact change has on them
* A broad appreciation of the thought process that went into past decisions
