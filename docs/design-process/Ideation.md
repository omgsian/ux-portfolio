# Ideation   

Ideation is the process where I generate early to mid stage ideas and final solutions. 

The typical activities that I do in this process are:

* **Flowchart**. In the early stages of a project, I begin articulating the flow of events, for every functionality. 
* **Wireframing and prototyping**. Typically, I begin ideation with low-to-midelity wireframes and stitching them together to create prototypes. In the ideation stage, I'm not concerned about the look and feel of the user interface, as much as I am concerned about the following:
    1. Does the content in the frame, meet the business or user goal?
    2. Does the flow of events in the prototype, make sense?
    2. Is this design technically feasible?
* **Design reviews**. All throughout the wireframing and prototyping process of ideation, I involve stakeholders from product management, customer support, and engineering to give their feedback on the prototypes. Using a [feedback loop framework](../resources.md), I consider each feedback, and incorporate them where possible, 

## Example outputs

* Low to mid-fidelity wireframes
* Conceptual prototypes
* Task flowcharts / analysis
* Notes around assumptions
