# About Ridzwan

My name is Ridzwan and I try to the very best Ridzwan that I can be. I'm creative, curious and driven by data. I'm a UX/product designer and user researcher with 5+ years of experience in big and small companies with a demonstrated ability to cut out the complexity. I'm skilled in leading quantitative and qualitative research and have built scalable research and design systems from scratch. I value **[transparency](my-values.md#transparency)**, **[closeness](my-values.md#closeness)**, **[connection](my-values.md#connection)**, **[knowledge sharing](my-values.md#knowledge-sharing)**, and [**continuous learning**](my-values.md#continuous-learning). Find out how best to work with me by reading **[my manual](working-with-me.md)**.

While I'm open to _most_ opportunities, I favour working with multinational companies and mid-to-late stage startups that operate in highly regulated industries e.g. healthcare, education, legal. The more opaque and stricter the regulations, the better (because that's where the real challenges are). I work only for companies that understand the value that UX designers can create and unlock for organisations, and not see designers as production units that push pixels.

I'm open to mentoring junior designers particularly those who are racial minorities or LGBTQ+.

Outside of work, I enjoy hiking (pre-pandemic), reading and urban exploration. I also work with a group of feeders looking after community cats in my neighbourhood.
