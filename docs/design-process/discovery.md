# Discovery   

Discovery is the process in which I start looking into customers' unmet needs and challenges.



* **Stakeholder interviews.** Knowing why this problem is worth solving from a business perspective gives clarity on how to connect those business goals to design goals. I identify and map stakeholders on a [2x2 matrix](https://www.mindtools.com/media/Diagrams/stakeholder-analysis-figure1-2020.jpg), and then, interview them to understand their perspective and how this change impacts them. Will this project potentially lead to higher sign-ups? Will this change reduce complaints from customers? Will this change improve a problematic funnel that's causing a negative user experience? Will this change impact the work that they do now?
* **Acquiring past (internal) documents about the problem.** Learning the historical context from existing documents (e.g. customer research, customer support tickets) expands my understanding of the need for change, explains why things are the way they are, and sometimes informs what might be.

## Expected outputs

* A one-page [design brief](../work-in-progress)
* A clearer understanding on the business goals, and how it influences design goals
* A full view of the involved stakeholders, their level of influence, and impact change has on them
* A broad appreciation of the thought process that went into past decisions



“Just as looking to the past helps understand the present, learning about the latest offers glimpses of possible future. We continually seek out the latest news and stories about the most advanced development, technique, or level of knowledge achieved in the topic. We look out for cutting-edge work. We look for innovations that are on the frontiers. We probe to identify the underlying forces and conditions that cause the formation of these frontiers. We learn from thought leaders whose latest thinking drives those innovations. All this is a great way to foresee what might happen next and what promising opportunities are ahead.
Understanding the latest developments at the frontiers helps us see the near-future context in which our innovations should work.
