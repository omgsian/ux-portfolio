# About Ridzwan

My name is Ridzwan and I try to be the very best version of myself that I can be. I'm creative, curious and take a data-informed approach to user-centred design. I'm a UX designer with 5+ years of professional experience across big and small companies with a demonstrated ability to cut out the complexity. I'm skilled in running qualitative and quantitative research, and building design systems from scratch. In the last five years, I've helped teams to:

* Scaled up product feedback cycles by creating and scaling up user communities 
* Shifted design team cultures to measure the design impact
* Scaled up design operations by creating templates and introducing frameworks that can benefit the design team

My values centre around **[transparency](my-values.md#transparency)**, **[closeness](my-values.md#closeness)**, **[connection](my-values.md#connection)**, **[knowledge sharing](my-values.md#knowledge-sharing)**, and [**continuous learning**](my-values.md#continuous-learning). You can also find out how best to work with me in **[my manual](my-manual.md)**.

I prefer to work with multinational companies and mid-to-late stage startups that operate in highly regulated industries e.g. healthcare, education, legal. The more opaque the regulations, the better it is (because that's where the real challenges are). I love companies that understand the value that UX designers can unlock for organisations, and not companies that see designers as only a production unit responsible for pushing pixels.

I'm open to mentoring junior designers particularly those who are racial minorities or LGBTQ+.

Outside of work, I enjoy hiking (pre-pandemic), reading and urban exploration. I'm also a community feeder for cats in my neighbourhood.

## Design guidelines

* **I believe that content drives design.** I like working at mid-fidelity levels until I feel confident that the content and design complements each other.
* **I mix quantitative data with qualitative data.** I harness the power of qualitative data to complement the rich user insights I get to maximise buy-in on change.
* **I reuse available research as much as I can.** I snoop on old documents to find insights informing my designs. I also reference scholarly papers where needed.
* **I get feedback and test early.** I look for opportunities to share my designs early, even if I havenâ€™t achieved that 80% confidence.
