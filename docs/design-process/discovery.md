# Discovery   

Discovery is the process in which I look at both the present and future states. I speak to customers to identify unmet needs and  unaddressed challenges - or as I call it, the gap. 

The typical activities that I engage in during this process are:

* **Secondary research**. I rely on information available out there to gain an appreciation of the problem I'm solving. Some examples of secondary research include thought leadership articles, scholarly papers, relevant tweets etc. I summarise my learnings from these various sources, and use them to create better conversations with my customers.
* **Customer and subject-matter expert interviews**. I create an interview plan, consisting of burning questions I have that is informed by the secondary research I have done, and run those interview sessions. Interviews can take in various formats - 1:1 interviews, focus groups, workshops, etc, but the overall goal is to gain a picture of who it is I'm designing for.  
* **Competitors' analysis**. I study both direct and indirect competitors to learn how they're closing the gaps. Studying competitors can be a never-ending task, and it's important that clear dimensions e.g. market share, feature offerings, customer complaints are decided on right from the start.
* **Research on frontier innovation**. I learn on the latest glimpses of possible future from advanced development, technique, innovations on the frontiers that I can bring into the project.
