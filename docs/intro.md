# About Ridzwan

My name is Ridzwan and I try to be the very best Ridzwan that I _personally_ can be. I'm creative, curious and driven by data. I'm a UX/product designer and user researcher with 5+ years of experience in big and small companies with a demonstrated ability to cut out the complexity. I'm skilled in running quantitative and qualitative research and have built scalable research and design systems from scratch. As a person, I value **[transparency](my-values.md#transparency)**, **[closeness](my-values.md#closeness)**, **[connection](my-values.md#connection)**, **[knowledge sharing](my-values.md#knowledge-sharing)**, and [**continuous learning**](my-values.md#continuous-learning). Find out how best to work with me by reading **[my manual](my-manual.md)**.

While I'm open to _most_ opportunities, I favour working with multinational companies and mid-to-late stage startups that operate in highly regulated industries e.g. healthcare, education, legal. The more opaque and stricter the regulations, the better (because that's where the real challenges are). I love companies that understand the value that UX designers can unlock for organisations, and not see designers as only a production unit responsible for pushing pixels.

I'm open to mentoring junior designers particularly those who are racial minorities or LGBTQ+.

I have experience using Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch and Protopie.

Outside of work, I enjoy hiking (pre-pandemic), reading and urban exploration. I also work with a group of feeders looking after community cats in my neighbourhood.
