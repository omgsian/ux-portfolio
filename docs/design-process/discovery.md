# Discovery   

Discovery is the process in which I look at both the present and future states. I speak to customers to identify unmet needs and  unaddressed challenges - or as I call it, the gap. I study both direct and indirect competitors to learn how they're closing the gaps. And, I learn about the latest glimpses of possible future from advanced development, technique, innovations on the frontiers that I can bring into the project. 

The typical activities that I engage in during this process are:

* **Customer interviews**.
* **Secondary research**. Some examples of secondary research include thought leadership articles, scholarly papers, relevant tweets.
* **Thought leadership articles**. 
* **Competitors' analysis**. Where possible, I study the competitors' offerings in order to understand how these offerings are closing the gaps I had identified. 
* **Subject matter expert interviews**.

## Example outputs

* Customer personas
* Journey maps
* Needs landscape
* Competitor analysis document
