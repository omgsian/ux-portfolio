# My manual

## My work preferences ...

* The goal is clear, but I have the autonomy to figure out how to get there.
* I believe in asynchronous work most of the time. Synchronous, real-time calls are great, but should come with a clear agenda and a set of actions to walk away with. 
* I care about having control over my calendar and block significant chunks of time so that I can get work done.
* I believe in minimal calls, so if I ask you if a call is necessary, it's nothing personal.
* I have a pulse of how I’m doing (ie: what’s going well; what isn’t) and it’s at least partially measurable.

## My availabilty

There’s a lot of information flying around, so if you hear something that doesn’t sound right, or want clarifying details on something. I keep my availability open on my work calendar. But come by my desk, stop me in the hallway, shoot me a Slack message or look for me at our next scheduled 1:1.

## After hours communication

* I make a strong effort to not contact you outside of working hours. For any reason, if I need you urgently, I will page you, but this is extremely unlikely. Please extend the same courtesy to me.
* I may send emails outside of working hours, but hold no expectations for you to reply immediately, especially if we're in different time zones. 
* With Slack, I use the schedule message functionality if I'm sending you a message outside of your working hours. 
* I try to respond on time, but may not always do it quickly. If I read a message and it comes off as non-urgent, I do take my time. If your message is urgent, I always appreciate it to be explicitly stated. 

## The best way to give me feedback is …

* **Make it timely.** I appreciate people who give feedback right away instead of waiting to raise it at the next meeting. Likewise, I try to give feedback as quickly as possible, in the moment if I can.
* **Make it clear.** Clear feedback is sufficiently detailed with goals to meet without it being prescriptive of the actions to take.

## The best way to help me is ...

* **Disagree with me**. Remind me that I'm wrong. If you disagree with me, let me know. The best solutions result from debate. I'll challenge your ideas with the goal of coming to the best solution, so please return the favor by challenging mine as well. 
* **Tell me when I screw up.** This is very important. I screw up and sometimes don’t notice. Be specific about what was wrong and where went wrong and why it went wrong so that I can learn and not repeat it. 

## I can help you ...

* **By providing context.** I spent time collecting, filtering and sharing context/information from other projects and domain. If I know it can help someone, I share.
* **Cheering you on.** I will celebrate your successes. If you're not the type to promote your own success, please let me do it for you. Tell me when things go well, share the things which make you proud, and I'll cheer and highlight your success appropriately.
* **Giving you perspective**. I may not know what you are working on a day to day basis, but will be close enough to give you an informed perspective that you may or may not take.
* **Communicate.** It's important that tasks have sufficient details. If you're missing them, let me know and I’ll fill you in or go find out.

## You know I'm stressed when ...

* I’m not communicating effectively or engaging in conversation.
* I have sad resting face, though this doesn't always mean anything most of the time


## When I'm dealing with stress, I ...

* Take long walks or hikes.
* Prepare myself a good, nourishing meal.
* Go for a swim.
